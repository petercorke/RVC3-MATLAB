# Figures

Figures included in the book are organized first by figure type, then by chapter.  The types are:

* [line_drawings](./line_drawings) which have been manually drawn using [EazyDraw for Mac](http://eazydraw.com) and exported as EPS files.
* [code](./code) which have been generated by Python code.  There is one Python script per figure that generates a PDF file for one or more subfigures.
